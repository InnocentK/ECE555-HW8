# Description:
#	Write and run a program to simulate an M/E2/1 queue and obtain realizations of 
#	the four stochastic processes defined in Example 6.2. Plot these realizations. You
#	may use a simulation language such as SIMULA or GPSS or you may use one
#	of the standard high-level languages. You will have to generate random deviates
#	of the interarrival time distribution (assume arrival rate Î» = 1 per second) and
#	the service time distribution (assume mean service time 0.8 s) using methods of
#	Chapter 3.
